## BFS Questions

- Use a queue `q = collections.deque()` to store the nodes to be visited
- To move in different directions, define a list of directions `dirs = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, depending
  on which direction you can move
- Use a matrix `visited` (or a set) to store the visited nodes, avoid vising the same node multiple times and 
  getting stuck in a loop

### 1091. [Shortest Path in Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/description/) (Medium)

The question asks for shortest clear path, where a _clear path_ is a path on which all cells have value `0`.
In this question, length of shortest path is defined as the number of cells visited. We can move in 8 directions,
including diagonals.
So basically, we can treat `0` as a road and `1` as a wall.

Very important questions to ask:
1. Which directions can I move?
2. How to keep track of the path length?
3. **When to mark a cell as visited?** When we add it to the queue or when we pop it from the queue?

[Solution](shortest_path_in_binary_matrix.py):
- Define 8 directions
- Define start and end cells: `start = (0, 0)`, `end = (m - 1, n - 1)`
- Check for cases where the start or end cell is blocked
  - If the start cell or end cell is `1`, return -1
- Check for simplest case
  - If the start and end cells are the same, return 1
- Initialize _queue_ and _visited_ matrix
  - `q = collections.deque()`
  - `visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]`
- Add start cell to queue and mark it as visited
  - Note: we always mark a cell as visited when we _add_ it to the queue, this is because we want to avoid adding
    the same cell to the queue multiple times, which will cause infinite loop; in other words, _each cell can only be
    added to the queue once_
  - `q.append((0, 0, 1))`, in our queue, each element has 3 components: _row index, column index, and distance from start_,
    in this question, distance is number of cells on the path, so we initialize it to 1
  - `visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True`
- While the queue is not empty
  - Pop the first cell from the queue, `row, col, dist = q.popleft()`
  - Use a `for` loop to check all directions, and do the following:
    - 'new_row = row + dir[0]', 'new_col = col + dir[1]
    - Check if the cell is a valid move by checking the following:
      - (1) Are the indices out of bound?
      - (2) Is the cell visited?
      - (3) Is the cell blocked? (i.e. is the cell `1`?)
    - Check if the cell is the _end cell_: if we have reached the end cell, we want to compare all path lengths
      that lead to this cell. We can't just return the first path length that we remove from queue.
      - `shortest_path_distance = math.inf` is used to keep track of the shortest path distance, this is defined outside the while loop
      - Update shortest path distance, if `dist + 1` is smaller than the current shortest path distance
    - Finally, append the cell to the queue and mark it as visited
      - `q.append((new_row, new_col, dist + 1))`
      - `visited[new_row][new_col] = True`
- Eventually, return `-1` if the shortest path distance is `math.inf`, otherwise return the shortest path distance
